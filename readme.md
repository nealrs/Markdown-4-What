Markdown 4 What?!
=====

It bothers me that Facebook dosen't natively support Markdown, so I wrote a Chrome Extension that does.

I started with Donald Little's [Hackathon Hackers](https://github.com/dmlittle/hackathon-hackers-facebook-tags) extension, dropped in Christopher Jeffery's [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) library, and wrote like 12 lines of javascript.

MD4W is kind of slow right now, but I only spent 30 minutes on it. Certainly there are improvements to be made. Oh yeah, and hashtags & @mentions are probably broken. In fact, I'd probably only use this for **bold**, _italic_, and inline `code` spans.

You'll have to load it as an unpacked extension to try it out, but give it a shot!
